Computer has negative effects to children Nowadays , thanks to the development of technology , computer is now indispensable to life . Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . In my opinion , the latter opinion is true . First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . It is a well - known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non - stop playing for 3 days . Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose .
